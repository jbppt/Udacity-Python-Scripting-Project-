# Udacity-Python-Scripting-Project-
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present descriptive statistics. This Repository contains the script and the data files used.
